Title: Super Learning for Conditional Survival Functions with Right-Censored Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ted Westling
Maintainer: Ted Westling <twestling@math.umass.edu>
Description: This package provides functions for estimating and predicting conditional survival functions
    for the event and censoring times from right-censored data. The method is based on the general 
    SuperLearner methodology (van der Laan et al., 2007), and the code is similary in functionality to
    that from the SuperLearner package.
